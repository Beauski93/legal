Frequently Asked Questions 
----------------
Version 1.0 - January 2017

#### I don't take insurance. My customers pay for materials fully updront. Why would I need Patch?

We get it. No one wants to deal with insurers. That's exactly what Patch is useful for. Patch allows you to continue not taking insurance (stay "out-of-network") while helping your customers find their "out-of-network" insurance benefits that they can use towards purchases. 

"Out-of-network" benefits are difficult to find and use. Patch's digital platform removes an annoying, manual, and time-consuming process and makes it digital. Now, when customers call or drop-in, you can mention that they can use their "out-of-network" benefits and you'll help them with it. 

#### I currently call to get a patient's "out-of-network" benefits and then fill out their claim paperwork manually right now. Isn't this a lot to pay for something I can already do for free?

If you think that phone calls and paperwork don't hamper your business, then that's great! We're certainly not a solution for everyone. Patch is likely a good fit for ECPs that:

* Any dispensery that wants to improve their customer experience
* Want to provide a better and more strealined experience for their patients and customers
* Are fed up contracting with certain vision plans and would prefer to drop them
* Are entirely out-of-network
* Want to go digital and have a database of their patients/customers in one place  


#### What are my committments? Are there setup fees and am I locked into a long-term contract?

We don't operate like traditional software companies. There is no setup fee and our subscriptions are month-by-month. Cancel anytime. Hopefully, if we do our job right, you won't want to!

#### My customers/patients currently file for their own reimbursements. They don't complain. 

We've found it's quite common for people to not know they have insurance benefits they can use. Also, people either fill out the claims wrong or forget to do it all together. This is a bad experience for most people. You can easily eliminate this pain point for them. You're more likely to have happier and higher value customers. 

#### Can I assign benefits to my location?

We're working on it. Stay tuned!

#### Which vision plans does Patch support?

We currently support "out-of-network" plans and benefits with the following companies: 

* VSP
* EyeMed
* Davis
* Spectera
* Superior
* Aetna Vision
* Cigna Vision
* Blue View 
* MESVision

#### What are the typical out-of-network vision benefits?

It highly depends on the insurer and the plan. For example, benefits can range from $60 - $100 for frames and lenses. It's important to know the benefits and eligibility exactly, so that customers do not get upset and waste your time.
