=============
HIPAA Authorization 
----------------
Version 1.0 - October 2016

The purpose of this HIPAA Authorization (“Authorization”) is to request your written permission to allow Patch to use and disclose your PHI as described in the Patch Terms of Service and in the Patch Privacy Policy. Your decision to e-sign the Patch Authorization is entirely voluntary. If Patch is a Business Associate of your Healthcare Providers or health plan, Patch needs your Authorization to be able to use and disclose your PHI when working on its own behalf.  Therefore, when Patch relies on this Authorization, and uses and discloses PHI as described in this Authorization, it is not working as a Business Associate and the HIPAA requirements that apply to Business Associates will not apply to such uses and disclosures.

If you e-sign this Authorization, you give your permission to Patch to retain your PHI and to use and/or disclose your PHI in the same way that you have agreed that your Non-PHI can be used and disclosed. 

Specifically, you agree that Patch can use your PHI to:
- enable and customize your use of the Patch Services; 
- provide you alerts or other Patch Services;
- share information with you regarding services, products or resources about which we think you may be interested in learning more;
- provide you with updates and information about the Patch Services;
- market to you about Patch and third party products and services;
- conduct analysis for Patch’s business purposes; 
- support development of the Patch Services; and
- create de-identified information and then use and disclose this information in any way permitted by law, including to third parties in connection with their commercial and marketing efforts.
You also agree that Patch can disclose your PHI to:
- third parties assisting Patch with any of the uses described above;
- a third party as part of a potential merger, sale or acquisition of Patch; 
- our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to the operation or provision of our services, even when Patch is no longer working on behalf of your Covered Entity; and
- organizations that collect, aggregate and organize your information so they can make it more easily accessible to your Covered Entities.
Re-disclosure

If Patch discloses your PHI, Patch will require that the person or entity receiving your PHI agrees to only use and disclose your PHI to carry out its specific business obligations to Patch or for the permitted purpose of the disclosure (as described above). Patch cannot, however, guarantee that any such person or entity to which Patch discloses your PHI or other information will not re-disclose it in ways that you or we did not intend or permit.

### Expiration and Revocation of Authorization
This Authorization will terminate/expire upon you providing your revocation of authorization to Patch by contacting us at help@getpatch.com, or by U.S. mail at 995 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103. Once Patch receives your revocation of authorization, Patch can only use and disclose your PHI as permitted in Patch’s agreements with your Covered Entities. Your revocation of authorization does not affect Patch’s use of your Non-PHI. We will make available to your Covered Entities, current and past, your agreement to or revocation of this Authorization.
