Welcome to Bauxy.com, the website and online service of Glass Health, Inc.

This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the **“Service”**). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Bauxy.com Privacy Statement, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. We reserve the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below. 

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. BY ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING, USING, PURCHASING, OR SUBSCRIBING TO THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF SERVICE (THESE **"TERMS"**), FEES AND PRICING POLICY, AND PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THIS "AGREEMENT"). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to this Agreement, then you do not have our permission to use the Services.

This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (**“Users”**) and takes effect when you click an "I Accept" button or checkbox presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Services (the **"Effective Date"**).

### 1. Eligibility
The Service is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of thirteen (13). We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to create Service accounts and submit personally identifiable information. By agreeing to this Agreement, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 13 years of age; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) your registration and your use of the Services is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that organization. Bauxy may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity, and may change its eligibility criteria at any time.

### 2. Account Information and Authorizations 
In order to use and/or access certain aspects of the Service, we need your authorization to retrieve and manage information of yours maintained by certain third-party institutions, such as health insurance companies with which we will process your out-of-network reimbursement claims. Further, in order for us to provide those aspects of the Service, you must provide us with all relevant and necessary information for us to provide the Service, including signatures, data, passwords, usernames, PINs, and other information, materials, and content as we may specify. Collectively, the information described in this paragraph is “Account Information.”

You represent and warrant that the Account Information you provide us is accurate, complete and you will keep such information current (e.g., you will update this information when changes are made do any Account Information), and that you are entitled and authorized to submit it to us without any obligations, restrictions, or limitations on us, including but not limited to the payment of fees, and you agree that we will have no liability or other responsibility for the inaccuracy or incompleteness of the Account Information, or your inability to use the Service due to such inaccuracy or incompleteness. You also acknowledge and agree that you are and will be responsible for the consequences of any instructions you provide us, and that we follow based on your instructions.

Accordingly, in connection with our processing of your out-of-network reimbursement claims, you designate us as your agent and attorney-in-fact in connection with such services, and further authorize us to: 

1. Store your Account Information, insurance plan information, and eligibility information; 
2. Access the relevant service using the Account Information you provide us; 
3. Use any signatures or other materials you provide us in order to provide you the Service; 
4. Gather and export from such service any data or other information reasonably necessary for us to provide the Service to you; 
5. Otherwise take any action in connection with such service as reasonably necessary for us to provide the Service to you, with the full power and authority to do and perform each thing necessary in connection with such activities, as you could do in person, including but not limited to authorizing us to receive your reimbursements from insurers and out-of-network providers in our name on your behalf and to communicate with such insurers and providers on your behalf in order to manage your out-of-network reimbursement claims. While the Service may be endorsed by the third-parties with whom your Account Information is held from time to time, you should not assume that we are working directly with any such third-party or that such third-party has sponsored or endorsed the Service or our interaction with such third-party’s services at your direction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that those third-party service providers are entitled to rely on the foregoing authorization, agency, and power of attorney granted by you. 

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN WE ARE ACCESSING AND RETRIEVING ACCOUNT INFORMATION FROM THIRD-PARTY SITES, WE ARE ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT AS THE AGENT OF OR ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD-PARTY THAT OPERATES THE THIRD-PARTY SITE.

Further, you agree to be notified of the status of your out-of-network reimbursement claims via the Service or the personal email address you have on file with us, as applicable. You are entitled to withdraw your consent to your designation of us as your agent and attorney-in-fact in connection with the Service by contacting us at help@bauxy.com.

We cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. We cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings.

### 3. Passwords, Usernames and Accounts

Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and we or our third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void.

You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store-Sourced Software or your possession and use of that App Store-Sourced Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Bauxy, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement. You and Bauxy acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your license of the App Store-Sourced Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the Terms of Service of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as relates to your license of the App Store-Sourced Software against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver

### 17. Governing Law
You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Santa Clara County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

### 18. Arbitration
READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM COMPANY. 

For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at help@bauxy.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and Bauxy agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.

### 19. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND BAUXY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

### 20. General Assignment
This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

### 21. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.
We may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by us in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Bauxy is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the version number and date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

### 22. Entire Agreement/Severability
This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Bauxy in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.

### 23. No Waiver
No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
