Rebate Services Agreement
----------------
Version 2.0 - November 2021

This Rebate Services Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between Anagram Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at [Location] (“Anagram”), and [Provider Name], a [STATE] [ENTITY] with offices at [Location] (“Provider”). This Agreement is effective as of [Date] (the “Effective Date”).

### 1. 
**Rebate Program**. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each party will perform the obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and as assigned to it below in support of Anagram’s rebate program (“Rebate Program”):

#### 1.1 

**Offer of Rebate-Eligible Products**. During the Term, Provider will promote (subject to the terms of this Agreement), offer and honor Rebates (as defined below) for in-office patients and other consumers (collectively, “Consumers”) that purchase products from Provider to which a Rebate applies (such products, “Rebate-Eligible Products”), in each case in compliance with all applicable laws in relevant jurisdictions, including without limitation Section 5 of the FTC Act and state and federal consumer protection laws, rules and guidelines.

#### 1.2

**Price List Agreement**. In order to be eligible for the Rebate Program, Provider must enter into a price list agreement (“Price List Agreement”) with the manufacturer of Rebate-Eligible Products that it will make available to its Consumers which shall provide for a customized price list for such Rebate-Eligible Products. Provider shall not offer Rebates to Consumers and Anagram shall have no obligation to pay for Rebates for any products purchased from Provider that are not subject to a Price List Agreement.  Provider shall give Anagram at least 30 days written notice prior to terminating a Price List Agreement. Provider shall promptly reimburse Anagram for the full amount of any Rebates paid to Consumers after a Price List Agreement termination, if Provider fails to give notice as set forth herein.

#### 1.3
**Rebate Verification**. Provider acknowledges that the provision of the Rebate Program is contingent on Provider’s cooperation in promptly and diligently implementing all procedures requested by Anagram, or any third party designated by Anagram, to track and verify purchases of Rebate-Eligible Products (each, a “Rebate Verification Procedure”).  Provider represents and warrants that it will work diligently with Anagram, or any third party designated by Anagram, to furnish data as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the Rebate Program (such data, “Rebate Data”). Provider shall promptly reimburse Anagram for the full amount of any Rebates erroneously paid to Consumers, if Provider fails to implement a Rebate Verification Procedure or provide Rebate Data as requested. 

#### 1.4

**Rebates**. Subject to verification of Rebate Data, Anagram shall provide a rebate to each Consumer upon the Consumer’s purchase of a Rebate-Eligible Product (each, a “Rebate”). The amount of all Rebates shall be determined by Anagram and shall be subject to change in Anagram’s sole discretion.

#### 1.5
**Refunds; Returns; Invalid Purchases**.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a purchased Rebate-Eligible Product is subsequently returned or refunded or such purchase is voided or invalidated for any reason (each, an “Invalid Purchase”), Provider shall report such Invalid Purchase to Anagram through the Rebate Verification Procedure within the time period mandated in the Rebate Verification Procedure.  Provider shall promptly reimburse Anagram for the full amount of any Rebate paid to the Consumer for such Invalid Purchase. 

### 2. Intellectual Property. 

#### 2.1 
**Trademark License; Anagram Brand/Promotion Guidelines**. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each party (“Licensor”) hereby grants to the other party (“Licensee”) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to use the Licensor’s trademarks, logos and materials, as provided by the Licensor, each as amended by each respective Licensor from time to time (collectively, the “Marks”), solely in connection with Licensee’s performance under the Agreement. Provider’s use of Anagram’s Marks, including in connection with Provider’s promotion of Rebate-Eligible Products, will be subject to and comply strictly with Anagram’s guidelines and directions regarding the form and manner of use of Anagram’s Marks and promotion of Rebate-Eligible Products or Rebates, in each case as may be provided by Anagram from time to time (the “Brand/Promotion Guidelines”) and any amendments or updates to them as Anagram may provide in writing to Provider from time to time. Without limiting the foregoing, Provider shall ensure that all Rebates are disclosed, promoted and otherwise marketed to Consumers as rebate, loyalty, award or promotional offers. Each Licensee’s use of Licensor’s Marks will inure to the benefit of Licensor. Neither party shall use, register, or attempt to register in any jurisdiction any Mark that is confusingly similar to or incorporates any of the other party’s Marks. All uses of a party’s Marks, and all goodwill associated therewith, shall inure solely to the benefit of such party, and each party shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to its Marks. 

#### 2.2

**Rebate Data**. Provider hereby grants Anagram and its third-party providers a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers of sublicenses) right and license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, perform and display the Rebate Data, both during and after the Term: (i) in conjunction with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) to analyze, monitor, improve, and develop Anagram’s products and services, provided that Anagram will not disclose Rebate Data to third parties other than as needed to perform its obligations hereunder or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, unless such Rebate Data has been de-identified and/or aggregated such that it does not reasonably identify Provider as the source of such derivative data. Provider shall provide all necessary disclosures and obtain all necessary rights, consents and permissions from Consumers for the processing and disclosure of their Personal Information under applicable laws relating to or provided in connection with the Rebate Program. “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, and shall include “personal information”, “personal data” or other similar designation as defined by applicable data privacy laws.

#### 2.3

**Ownership**. As between the parties: (i) Anagram’s Confidential Information will remain owned solely and exclusively by Anagram and its suppliers; and (ii) Rebate Data will remain owned solely and exclusively by Provider. Each party hereby reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement.

The receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party of any actual or suspected misuse or unauthorized disclosure of any of the Confidential Information.

#### 6.3

**Return of Materials**.
